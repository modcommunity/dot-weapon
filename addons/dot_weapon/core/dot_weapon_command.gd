extends RefCounted

## What a player asked their weapon to do on one tick.
##
## The weapon half of dot-player-controller's [code]DotFpsCommand[/code], and separate
## from it for the same reason movement is separate from input sampling: the
## simulation must be a pure function of these, so that a client predicting a shot and
## a server re-running it reach the same answer. Nothing below reads a device, a
## clock, or a node.
##
## A game using both copies [member yaw] and [member pitch] across from the movement
## command rather than sampling the mouse twice — the two must agree exactly or the
## shot leaves the muzzle at a different angle than the one the player was looking
## along.
